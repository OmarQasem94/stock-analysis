# **Stocks Analysis**
Analysis of Green Energy Stocks



## **Overview of Project**
This project is designed to determine the best performing green energy stocks for the years 2017 and 2018 by identifying the total daily volume and yearly return for each stock.

#### Purpose
The aim of this project is to assist Steve with anyalyzing green energy stocks to determine whether his parents made the right choice in investing all their money into Daqo's stock or if they should diversify their money among other stocks.



## **Results**
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

#### Stock Performance
Utilizing VBA scripting, macros were modeled to analyze the performance of 12 green energy stocks over the years 2017 and 2018. The analysis focuses on two factors: The total daily volume, which depicts how actively each stock was traded and the yearly return. Upon administering the analysis it is evident that 2017 was a good year for green energy stocks. It saw positive returns for 11 out of the 12 companies of interest. Specifically DQ which saw a yearly return of 199.4% the highest of all stocks. However, DQ was the least traded stock throughout the year. Contrary to the results of 2017, 2018 oversaw losses for 10 out of the 12 stocks. The only stocks which oversaw positive yearly returns were ENPH and RUN. DQ recorded a loss of 62.6% in 2018, which means that over the two year period DQ has recorded a return of 136.8%. This puts DQ as one of the most profitable stocks over the two year period. However, ENPH and SEDG outperformed DQ and would have been better options. The optimal approach would have been to diversify and allocate some of the money into ENPH and SEDG. If an investor is only interested in putting all of his/her resources into one stock the optimal option would have been ENPH as it saw a return of 211.4% over the two years.

#### Execution Times
Furthermore, this analysis was subject to refactoring to optimize the script. The refactoring of the script has resulted in an increase in the time it took to execute the script. The analysis of the 2017 dataset took 0.93 seconds after the refactoring when compared to 0.50 seconds before the refactoring.

While the 2018 dataset took 0.96 seconds to tun as opposed to 0.48 seconds before the refactoring.

## **Summary**
For the purpose of this analysis refactoring the code provided several advantages including: made the code easier to comprehend, made the code more extensible for adding other functions, and the code would still be fully functional even if more datasets were added to account for more years. On the other hand refactoring the code icreased the time it took the code to run, and refactoring the code was time consuming which in certain cases could not be possible due to time constraints or budget issues.
